CSpire Mobi Provisioning Manager

We need to utilize a certificate from Mobi to access their server. Certificate import steps:

1. Find the JRE used for launching the Mobi PM. I am using C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_73
		The path can be found from within Eclipse by doing Window / Preferences / Java / Installed JREs and finding the path in the Location column
2. Update PATH env variable with C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_73\jre\bin (It may be different on your machine). This will make "keytool" command available to be run from any dir
		Add \jre\bin to the path found in step 0 and the location to the PATH environment variable. Control Panel / System / Advanced Settings / Environment Variables
3. Cd "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101\jre\lib\security"
		Bring up the cmd window as Administrator (From windows start icon, type cmd and right click cmd from the list of programs and run as administrator)
4. Import the certificates provided by Mobi using these 2 DOS commands:
	keytool -importcert -keystore cacerts -alias mobiPm -file "C:\Users\dgrimmer\workspace\Provisioning\mobipm\MobiSim.cer"
	keytool -importcert -keystore cacerts -alias mobiPmServer -file "C:\Users\dgrimmer\workspace\Provisioning\mobipm\mobiServer.cer"
		Note: change dgrimmer to your userid
		Note: password is changeit (default for java)
		Note: answer yes to “Trust this certificate” prompt
